## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

Although this was an easy project, it taught me proper semantic html tag usage.

They simplify the work of developers currently doing the project and future developers that may read it.

```html
<div class="text">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    <p>
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
        the next level
    </p>
</div>
```

The semantic h2 and p usage in this section helped with reducing the need to add additional styles to these two respective components because of h2's "font-weight: bolder" feature.

```css
.container {
    max-width: 360px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

"margin: 0 auto;"
-> this is useful because together with defining the max width of the container, it centralizes the object within the container.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus more on properly formatting the html in a way that will simplify my job when styling.
